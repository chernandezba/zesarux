Added setting to test configuration
Added menu to find and set lives in games
Added menu to view color palettes
Added actions commands to breakpoints, so you can run some actions when a breakpoint is fired
Added up to three AY Chips
Added emulation of other DAC chips appart from Specdrum: Covox, etc
Added Antonio Villena's "Kartusho" cartridge interface

Added ZX-Uno features: Radasoffset and Radaspadding registers, to do hardware scrolling
Added ESXDOS handler so file operations can be done with files stored on your computer hard disk, and not only on virtual mmc/ide files. Examples can be found on extras/media/spectrum/esxdos_handler/. "Classic" mmc/ide emulation by using virtual mmc/ide files can also be used
Added feature "memory zone" to ZRCP and all menus that inspect memory (debug, disassemble, sprites etc): now you can look at all memory zones, for example: full 128kb ram, 64kb rom of +2A, divmmc ram, or even load a file in this memory zone

The git repository still holds all the files (extras have been moved to folder "extras"), but maybe in the future I will remove them also from the repo.
Moved mmc/ide files location to extras/media/disk_images folder
