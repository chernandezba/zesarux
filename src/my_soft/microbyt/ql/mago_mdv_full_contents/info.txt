This is a full dump of microdrive contents "mago.mdv" (excluding programa Grafico that has i/o error)

Game Samantha has some errors:

- is missing some files:

Samantha0_lab
Grafico

Game is modified to omit these files so it does not fire any error (original is Samantha_orig, see differences).

- Seems to have missing/mixed/corrupted lines starting at 29997, so they are deleted

- The game is incomplete, it has the menu and then the game does nothing (it has the rendering maze routine but missing Samantha0_lab)
